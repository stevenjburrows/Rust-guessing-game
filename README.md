# 30 days of Rust

This is a 30 day challenge to learn a little about rust each day.  

I am new to Rust so learning the basics as I go.  This was Day 2 in my progress and I was just going through the [official documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).
